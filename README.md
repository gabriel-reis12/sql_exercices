# ðŸš€ Practicing SQL: My Journey Through Basic and Intermediate Challenges

Over the past few weeks, I've been diving deeper into SQL by solving a series of exercises designed to strengthen my understanding of database querying, filtering, aggregation, and joins. These challenges ranged from beginner-friendly tasks to more complex intermediate problems â€” and theyâ€™ve been incredibly rewarding!

## ðŸ§  What I Practiced

- Selecting and filtering data using `WHERE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`, and `LIKE`
- Aggregating results with `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `COUNT`
- Joining tables with `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `SELF JOIN`
- Subqueries and nested logic
- Window functions and ranking
- Data cleaning and transformation using SQL

Each exercise helped reinforce core concepts and exposed me to real-world scenarios that SQL professionals face daily.

## ðŸ“Š Why It Matters

SQL remains one of the most essential tools for data analysts, engineers, and anyone working with structured data. Practicing consistently has improved my confidence in writing efficient queries and interpreting complex datasets.
